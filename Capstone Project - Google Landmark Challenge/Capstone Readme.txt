Capstone_Steve_Tsiolis.ipynb and Capstone_Steve_tsiolis.html are the juypter notebook and html of the main portion of the code

Capstone_Steve_Tsiolis_benchmark.ipynb and Capstone_Steve_Tsiolis_benchmark.html are the juypter notebook and html of the benchmark model

train.csv contains all of the url's of the original dataset (unprocessed)

Download_pic folder contains three folders (test_set, train_set, validation_set) whereby the python script "download_script.py" is used to download all of the images in the p_train.csv,p_test.csv,p_validation.csv files.

download_script.py is a code taken from the official Kaggle challenge https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset and it not my writing.

Xception pre trained model used from Keras application library, more information at https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357
